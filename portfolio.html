            of the first VR movies database is represented on a simple website
            written in <b>Javascript</b>. I use <b>jQuery</b> which allows the quick and dynamic
            representation of the data. Such libraries like <b>lodash</b> and <b>underscore</b>
            makes it easier with functionality.
            In the meantime, a permanent version is being built using <b>React</b>
            for the front-end and for complex relational data I am using <b>PostgreSQL</b> with <b>Nodal</b>.

          <h3>Tom Toby Barton's Poetry Book Cover Design</h3>
          <p class="p-portfolio">
            Client had very specific needs to ensure the quotes override the visual
            aspect of the book cover. Focusing on primary colors with addition of few
            additional colors, adding dynamic fonts and juxtaposing quotes in atypical
            way, gave the book a little bit of visual surprise for the restricted cover.

          <p class="p-portfolio">
            I had a full power of logo idea and since the hackathon is organized
            in New Orleans, I decided to include New Orleans cityscape. The hackathon
            was held for high school students, therefore I chose a more relaxed,
            hand-drawn, imperfect looking design that it would correspond with younger
            hackathon audience. The logo was printed on t-shirts as well, so I wanted
            to ensure that the shirt would be worn afterwards as well.

            Grubbr is an alternative to Yelp - it works as Tinder but for food:
            it will match you with the best dish in town. It also allows to search for best
            menu items in restaurants, or simply look for specific food but ensures to
            be the best item by app's users. I created front-end architecture using
            <b>React Native</b> for its ability to expand on multiple interfaces
            without any restrictions. I applied <b>Native Base</b> library to enhance
            the rendering logic, allowing polished integration of new features like
            deck swipe. I designed the UI and app's artistic elements (the Fork Monster)
            with <b>Pixelmator</b>, and used <b>CSS</b> to improve app's overall looks
            and quality. Our team chose to use <b>Redux</b> to ensure the complicated flow of data,
            allowing the incorruptible transition of fetched data. For back-end we use
            <b>Node</b> and <b>Express</b>. For database we chose <b>PostgreSQL</b>
            because our data system is very complicated and required a relational data system
            for smooth and quick data retrieval. <b>Nodal</b> helped to quicken the
            database build process. The app is built for <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b>
            and I was responsible for integration of <b>iOS</b> features to esnure
            a better and uncomplicated <iOS> user experience.

            <b>Twilio API</b> services to inform people for the perfectly matched game.
            Our team expanded the choices of games from one to several. We integrated
            <b>Google API</b> for <b>geolocation</b>, to make sure, that the team is gathered at
            a similar location. I refactored the app into mobile platform integrating
            <b>Ionic</b> for its smooth compatibility with prebuilt <b>Angular</b> apps.
            I solved a major <b>Ionic</b> build error using proxies and whitelist, usurping built-in
            security hindrances.

            <b>Node</b> and <b>Express</b> is used for back-end. I utilized <b>Firebase</b> for

            <b>Mailgun API</b> is used for sending emails with transaction information.
